# Generate-Music-using-a-LSTM-Neural-Network
owadays, deep machine learning seems to be playing a significant role in many aspects of almost every field like image detectors, computer vision, medical and business analytic. But a multitude of the available models has been designed for image processing/ classification or text-processing where mostly a variant of CNN or feed-forward neural network is used to extract more in-depth features. However, there are many other realistic problems, where further research need to be carried out on deep machine learning models to address some prominent issues. One of these domains (which require further consideration) is that of music generation. Traditionally, music was treated as an analogue signal and was generated manually. However, in recent years, music is conspicuous to technology that can generate a suite of music automatically without any human intervention. To accomplish this task, we need to overcome some technical challenges to successfully generate a composition of notes having continuity and unity. This is where we can try for different Deep learning frameworks on sequential inputs other than images.
